Deep Space One
==============

Deep Space One is a demo project that guides you through the use and extension
mechanisms of the Symfony2 Form component.

Installation
------------

The project is based on the Symfony2 Standard Edition and can be installed just
like a Standard Edition project [0]:

1. Unpack the project directory to the document root of your web server

2. Add a virtual host configuration to your web server

3. Add the host name "ds1.phpsc14" to your "hosts" file

4. Make the app/cache, app/data and app/logs directories writable by your
   web server [1]

5. Install the project dependencies with Composer [2]:

   $ ./composer.phar install

   Note: If Composer fails because symfony/icu cannot be installed, check
   whether the ICU library is compiled with PHP:

   $ php -i | grep ICU

   If the output of that command is empty, add the following dependency to
   the composer.json file:

       "require": {
           ...
           "symfony/icu": "1.0.*"
       }

   If the output command is not empty, you should get something like this:

       ICU version => 4.8.1.1
       ICU Data version => 4.8.1

   If the displayed version is 4.2.* or lower, add the following dependency to
   the composer.json file:

       "require": {
           ...
           "symfony/icu": "1.1.*"
       }

   At last, rerun the Composer installation. The installation should now succeed.

5. Create and fill the database with the test fixtures:

   $ app/console doctrine:database:create
   $ app/console doctrine:schema:create
   $ app/console doctrine:fixtures:load

6. Dump the project assets:

   $ app/console assetic:dump

7. Open the project in your web browser and make sure that it works:

   http://ds1.phpsc14/app_dev.php

The download contains a Git repository with ready-made tags for the individual
steps of the workshop. If you're curious, you can list the tags like this:

   $ git tag

You can look at the code of each individual task by checking it out:

   $ git checkout task1-complete

Alternatively, you can display the diff in your shell:

   $ git show task1-complete

See you soon!
